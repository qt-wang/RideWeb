We found that in user main page, the rides that the user confirmed as a driver will also be shown on that page, which is reasonable but sometimes confusing

When driver confirm a ride, if the ride has a driverId that is not default value, we redirect that driver to driver main page and show an error message, 
so that the driver know he failed to confirm this ride

We add an exclude before rendering the usermain page, so that rides that the user confirmed as a driver will not be shown on that page
